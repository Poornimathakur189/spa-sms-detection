# SMS Spam Detection
 The code associated with this project is written in python programming language in a jupyter notebook with the file extension '.ipynb' .

## Text Classification Text classification has a variety of applications, such
as detecting user sentiment from tweets, classifying an email as spam or ham, classifying blog posts into different categories, automatic
tagging of customer queries, and so on. This process can be done manually (carried out by a human agent who reads texts and categorizes
them) or automatically (which involves machine learning algorithms that will classify your texts in a faster and more cost-effective way).

## Project description and workflow
In this project, I will demonstrate a real world example of text classification using machine learning. The goal of this project is to
train a text classification machine learning model in python capable of predicting whether a text message is spam or not. I will use
pythonâ€™s Scikit-learn library for machine learning to train the text classification model and below are the following steps I will go
through in the jupyter notebook to train the text classification model:
* Importing the libraries needed
* Importing the data set
* Text preprocessing
* Converting text to numbers
* Splitting the data into train and test sets
* Training the text classification model and predicting SMS messages as spam or ham
* Evaluating the  model
* Saving and loading the model
